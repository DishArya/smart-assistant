#  Smart Assistant for Research Summarization

An intelligent, document-aware GenAI assistant that can understand and reason over research papers, legal texts, and other large documents. Built to answer user questions and generate logic-based quizzes with justification — all grounded in the actual content of uploaded PDF or TXT files.
